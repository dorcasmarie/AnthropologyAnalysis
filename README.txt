# Collection Cluster Analysis

## Goals:
The goal of this project to utilize WorldCat's API and gather information on our anthropology collection (obtained from a SQL query). Specific we'd like to know what how many other libraries have the monograph, where is the next closest copy and which other libraries in OhioLink have it. We'd also like to look at the subject headings in the bibilographic record and cluster similar ones together and see if any subjects show a strong presense in our collection. We are gathering by subject and call number. Together they should work to express strengths.

## Step 1:
Run sql query to get anthropology monographs in OhioLink with bcode2 = and ... [Jeff] 

## Step 2:
Use OCLC's API to gather more holdings information as defined above

## Step 3:
Use Sierra API to gather biolographic info such as subject

## Step 4:
Use R to cluster
